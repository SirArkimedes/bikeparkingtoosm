# Thanks

Thanks to all of the map contributors in Lakewood. Everyone went out of their way and spent a large amount of time searching for bike parking locations all around the city. Special thanks to [Jenny Gritton](https://www.lakewoodtogether.org/bikeplanupdate/widgets/80704/team_members) for organizing and setting this up!
